<h3 id="nocturnal-animals-review-tom-ford-returns-with-wildly-gripping-revenge-tale">Nocturnal Animals review Tom Ford returns with wildly gripping revenge tale.</h3>
<p>As shot by the gifted cinematographer Seamus McGarvey Nocturnal Animals is beautifulor at least arrestingevery minute and it sure isnt boring. Nocturnal Animals adapted by Ford from Austin Wrights novel Tony and Susan features tightly-controlled anguished performances from its talented cast but is long on repellent or inscrutable detail. Similar to the presence of camel in the desert who can survive with less water there are some animals are born to be nocturnal. This is a re-post of my review from the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival. Seven years is no bad luck for a keen-eyed fashion designer turned meticulous filmmaker Tom Ford arrestingly attests in his new high-art-pulp-fiction thriller NOCTURNAL ANIMALS. Winter is the easiest time to identify calls because there are fewer options.</p>

<p><strong>Home Network Patch Panel Enclosure</strong>. The compact design of the Racky Rax 8u Cabinet makes it the ideal housing for small network requirements allowing integration of voice data ISDN and internet connections in one neat unit. These devices come handy when you are building a network and there are a lot of ethernet cables. The network part of my CWP is simply an enclosure with three adjustable shelves. You will want to add to your home network down the road so plan for expansion.</p>
